    <h3 style="text-align:center;padding:20px;">Dads Meet Dads is more than just a cool place for rad dads to hang out, meet each other and build lasting lifetime friendships-- it's a way of life. </h3>
    <p style="text-align:center;padding:20px">Dads Meet Dads is a fake social networking site developed by Will Nedds. It was first conceived as an April Fools joke, but was later developed as a stand-alone product for his CS008 final project. You will most likely not meet any dads by visiting this website. All of the names in the "Dads You May Know" section are randomly generated, using pictures taken from the University of Vermont faculty web pages. No dads you may meet through this site are real. Enjoy browsing through the site, and good luck meeting future dads!
