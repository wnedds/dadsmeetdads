    <h3 style="text-align:center;padding:20px;">Dads Meet Dads is more than just a cool place for rad dads to hang out, meet each other and build lasting lifetime friendships-- it's a way of life. </h3>
    <p style="text-align:center;padding:20px">Dads Meet Dads is a fake social networking site developed by Will Nedds. It was first conceived as an April Fools joke, but was later developed as a stand-alone product for his CS148 final project. Enjoy browsing through the site, and good luck meeting future dads!
