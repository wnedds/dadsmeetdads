Get in touch with your dad side on Dads Meet Dads, the first social network for giving neat dads the chance to meet up, hang out, swap stories, and maybe fix that one porch step that's been creaking for the last few months. Got a great home improvement project that could be made better with more dads like you? Meet some dads and build a new shed or something! Sign up and see how many dads in your area you can meet. Learn how to be the dad you always wanted to be! Be the envy of all the neighborhood dads, and show off your dad pride to all the world!</p>
